# Branch: feature/grades

# The grades database is a nested dictionary with this structure:

def add_grade(grades: dict, student_id: str, subject: str, score: int) -> dict:
    """
    Add or update a grade for a student in a given subject.

    - Score must be between 0 and 100 (inclusive).
      If not, print a warning and do NOT add the grade:
      "Invalid score: 110. Score must be between 0 and 100."
    - If student_id does not exist in grades yet, create their entry.
    - Overwrite the score if the subject already exists for that student.

    Args:
        grades (dict): the current grades database
        student_id (str): the student's ID
        subject (str): the subject name (e.g. "Math")
        score (int): the score between 0 and 100

    Returns:
        dict: the updated grades dictionary

    Example:
        >>> db = {}
